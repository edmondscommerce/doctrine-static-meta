# Relations

One of the primary pieces of functionality provided by Doctrine is to allow us to configure and implement the relationships between our objects.

There is a small list of the possible kinds of relations, though they can be largely grouped into two types:

 * ToMany
 * ToOne
 
 DoctrineStaticMeta also supports the full range of possible relations provided by Doctrine however the approach is opinionated and auto generated.
