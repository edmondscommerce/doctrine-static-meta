# Testing Your Project

The generated code for your project comes with a reasonable test coverage out of the box.

This is built around the [AbstractEntityTest](../src/Entity/Testing/AbstractEntityTest.php)

The Abstract Entity test handles the creation and of a test entity and also associated entities.

## Faker

Faker is used to generate the data and there is a mechanism for Fields to provide their own Faker data provider if the standard Faker guessing mechanism is not good enough.

### Custom Faker Data

Faker does a great job of guessing values to provide based on the Entity meta data. However for some fields you might want to roll somethign more custom.

This can be done by creating a new class that implements the [FakerDataProviderInterface](./../src/Entity/Fields/FakerData/FakerDataProviderInterface.php)

Once you have created the class, you also need to override the AbstractEntityTest::FAKER_DATA_PROVIDERS constant in your child test class

## Fixtures

When generating an Entity, there is a also a Fixture class generated in the `tests/Assets/EntityFixtures` folder.

This class implements the `FixtureInterface` from the [doctrine/data-fixtures](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures) module. This module provides a formal way of structuring and implementing test fixtures.

To use these fixtures, in your test class you should instantiate the [`FixturesHelper`](./../src/Entity/Testing/Fixtures/FixturesHelper.php) which provides you all the functionality to use your Fixtures to build up your test database. Also this helper will cache the SQL queries and can then just run the queries which can have a big speed improvement.

For each Fixture class generated by DSM, you can then instantiate it with your own `Modifier` which is an instance of [FixtureEntitiesModifierInterface](./../src/Entity/Testing/Fixtures/FixtureEntitiesModifierInterface.php). This is quite a small interface with only one method, though of course your implementation can be as complex as you like. As it is a small class, it is a good candidate for being implemented as an Anonymous class which is the way it is done in the [FixtureLoaderAndHelperTest](./../tests/Large/G/Entity/Testing/Fixtures/FixtureLoaderAndHelperTest.php)
